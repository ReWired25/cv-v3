  INFO: 'I have been involved in the frontend development for more than a year, during which there was a bright and very intensive training in the "walls" of Rolling Scopes with a large community and with mentors as practicing developers. During this period, a number of projects were made (both layouts and applications with a certain business logic), two relatively large team projects with a supervising mentor, video presentations related to frontend and adjacent areas. At the moment, in development, I am interested in the continuation of development in the web and the study of related areas (primarily algorithms and data structures to strengthen the fundamental base of the language).',
  INTERESTS:
    'My interests: music, history, to some extent philosophical literature and the progress of hardware technology.',
